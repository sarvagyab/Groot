hen Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,
W every one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no doubt at
all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville himself, who was a
man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his duty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis

when they came to discuss terms.
"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves," said Lord Canterville, "since my
grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was frightened into a fit, from which she
never really recovered, by two skeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was
dressing for dinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been seen by
several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of the parish, the Rev.
Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge. After the unfortunate
accident to the Duchess, none of our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady
Canterville often got very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises that
came from the corridor and the library."
"My Lord," answered the Minister, "I will take the furniture and the ghost at a
valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we have everything that money can
buy; and with all our spry young fellows painting the Old World red, and carrying off your
best actors and prima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in
Europe, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public museums, or on the
road as a show."
"I fear that the ghost exists," said Lord Canterville, smiling, "though it may have resisted
the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It has been well known for three centuries,
since 1584 in fact, and always makes its appearance before the death of any member of
our family."
"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But there is no such
thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature are not going to be suspended for the
British aristocracy."
"You are certainly very natural in America," answered Lord Canterville, who did not
quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, "and if you don't mind a ghost in the house, it
is all right. Only you must remember I warned you."

MISS VIRGINIA E. OTIS
A few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close of the season the
Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase. Mrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia
R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had been a celebrated New York belle, was now a very
handsome, middle-aged woman, with fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American
ladies on leaving their native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the
impression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had never fallen into this
error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a really wonderful amount of animal spirits.
Indeed, in many respects, she was quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact
that we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course,
language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents in a moment of patriotism,
which he never ceased to regret, was a fair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who
had qualified himself for American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport
Casino for three successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an excellent
dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses. Otherwise he was
extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little girl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a
fawn, and with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and
had once raced old Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length
and a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight of the young Duke of
Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and was sent back to Eton that very night
by his guardians, in floods of tears. After Virginia came the twins, who were usually called
"The Star and Stripes," as they were always getting swished. They were delightful boys,
and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only true republicans of the family.
As Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway station, Mr. Otis

had telegraphed for
a waggonette to
meet them, and
they started on their
drive in high spirits.
It was a lovely July
evening, and the air
was delicate with
the scent of the
pinewoods. Now
and then they heard
a wood-pigeon
brooding over its
own sweet voice,
or saw, deep in the
rustling fern, the
burnished breast of
the pheasant. Little
squirrels peered at
them from the
beech-trees as they
went by, and the
rabbits scudded
away through the
brushwood and "HAD ONCE RACED OLD LORD BILTON ON HER PONY"
over the mossy
knolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of Canterville Chase,
however, the sky became suddenly overcast with clouds, a curious stillness seemed to
hold the atmosphere, a great flight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before
they reached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.
Standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed in black silk,
with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the housekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at
Lady Canterville's earnest request, had consented to keep in her former position. She
made them each a low curtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned
manner, "I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase." Following her, they passed through
the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled in black oak, at the end of
which was a large stained glass window. Here they found tea laid out for them, and, after
taking off their wraps, they sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited
on them.
Suddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by the fireplace,
and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said to Mrs. Umney, "I am afraid
something has been spilt there."
"Yes, madam," replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, "blood has been spilt on
that spot."

"BLOOD HAS BEEN SPILLED ON THAT SPOT"
"How horrid!" cried Mrs. Otis; "I don't at all care for blood-stains in a sitting-room. It
must be removed at once."
The old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice, "It is the
blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that very spot by her own
husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575. Sir Simon survived her nine years, and
disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances. His body has never been
discovered, but his guilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much
admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed."
"That is all nonsense," cried Washington Otis; "Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover
and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time," and before the terrified housekeeper
could interfere, he had fallen upon his knees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a
small stick of what looked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the blood-
stain could be seen.
"I knew Pinkerton would do it," he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he looked round at his
admiring family; but no sooner had he said these words than a terrible flash of lightning lit
up the sombre room, a fearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.
Umney fainted.
"What  a  monstrous  climate!"  said  the  American  Minister,  calmly,  as  he  lit  a  long
cheroot. "I guess the old country is so overpopulated that they have not enough decent
weather for everybody. I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for
England."

"My dear Hiram," cried Mrs. Otis, "what can we do with a woman who faints?"
"Charge it to her like breakages," answered the Minister; "she won't faint after that;"
and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to. There was no doubt, however, that
she was extremely upset, and she sternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble
coming to the house.
"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir," she said, "that would make any Christian's
hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not closed my eyes in sleep for the
awful things that are done here." Mr. Otis, however, and his wife warmly assured the
honest soul that they were not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of
Providence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for an increase of
salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.
II
he storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note occurred.
T The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast, they found the
terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. "I don't think it can be the fault of
the Paragon Detergent," said Washington, "for I have tried it with everything. It must be
the ghost." He accordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning it
appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the library had been locked
up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key carried up-stairs. The whole family were now
quite interested; Mr. Otis began to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of
the existence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the Psychical Society,
and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the subject of
the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when connected with Crime. That night all doubts
about the objective existence of phantasmata were removed for ever.
The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family
went out to drive. They did not return home till nine o'clock, when they had a light supper.
The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary
conditions of receptive expectations which so often precede the presentation of psychical
phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned from Mr. Otis, were merely
such as form the ordinary conversation of cultured Americans of the better class, such as
the immense superiority of Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah Bernhardt as an actress;
the difficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in the best
English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of the world-soul; the
advantages of the baggage-check system in railway travelling; and the sweetness of the
New York accent as compared to the London drawl. No mention at all was made of the
supernatural, nor was Sir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock
the family retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time after, Mr. Otis was
awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside his room. It sounded like the clank
of metal, and seemed to be coming nearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a
match, and looked at the time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his
pulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued, and with it he heard
distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his slippers, took a small oblong phial out of

his dressing-case, and opened the door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan
moonlight, an old man of terrible aspect. His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey
hair fell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of antique cut, were
soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung heavy manacles and rusty gyves.
"My dear sir," said Mr. Otis, "I really must insist on your oiling those chains, and have
brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is
said to be completely efficacious upon one application, and there are several testimonials
to that effect on the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall leave it
here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to supply you with more, should
you require it." With these words the United States Minister laid the bottle down on a
marble table, and, closing his door, retired to rest.
"I REALLY MUST INSIST ON YOUR OILING THOSE CHAINS"
For a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural indignation; then,
dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor, he fled down the corridor, uttering
hollow groans, and emitting a ghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of
the great oak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures appeared,
and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently no time to be lost, so,
hastily  adopting  the  Fourth  dimension  of  Space  as  a  means  of  escape,  he  vanished
through the wainscoting, and the house became quite quiet.
On reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up against a moonbeam
to recover his breath, and began to try and realize his position. Never, in a brilliant and
uninterrupted career of three hundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought
of the Dowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before the glass
in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone into hysterics when he

merely grinned at them through the curtains on one of the spare bedrooms; of the rector
of the parish, whose candle he had blown out as he was coming late one night from the
library, and who had been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr
to nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having wakened up one
morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an armchair by the fire reading her diary, had
been confined to her bed for six weeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her
recovery, had become reconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection with that
notorious sceptic, Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible night when the
wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his dressing-room, with the knave of
diamonds half-way down his throat, and confessed, just before he died, that he had
cheated Charles James Fox out of £50,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card,
and swore that the ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back
to him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because he had seen a
green hand tapping at the window-pane, to the beautiful Lady Stutfield, who was always
obliged to wear a black velvet band round her throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt
upon her white skin, and who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the
King's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist, he went over his most
celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as he recalled to mind his last
appearance as "Red Reuben, or the Strangled Babe," his début as "Guant Gibeon, the
Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor," and the furore he had excited one lovely June evening
by merely playing ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And after all
this some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him the Rising Sun
Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite unbearable. Besides, no ghost in
history had ever been treated in this manner. Accordingly, he determined to have
vengeance, and remained till daylight in an attitude of deep thought.
III
he next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed the
T ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a little annoyed to
find that his present had not been accepted. "I have no wish," he said, "to do the
ghost any personal injury, and I must say that, considering the length of time he has been
in the house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw pillows at him,"—a very just remark, at
which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter. "Upon the other hand,"
he continued, "if he really declines to use the Rising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take
his chains from him. It would be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on
outside the bedrooms."
For the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing that excited
any attention being the continual renewal of the blood-stain on the library floor. This
certainly was very strange, as the door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the
windows kept closely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a
good deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red, then it would be
vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came down for family prayers,
according to the simple rites of the Free American Reformed Episcopalian Church, they
found it a bright emerald-green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party
